## Wiener Linien - data visualisation / shiny web application

I created a shiny web application that allows the user to select a station within the Viennese local transportation system for which the upcoming departures are shown, together with a map indicating where the station is located. 
The application can be accessed here: https://lisahlmsch.shinyapps.io/DV3_homework_assignment/
