## Whats app chat analysis
I used a whats app group chat history to analyse the patterns in the conversations. I used sentiment analysis, topic modelling, checked similarities among chat members, unique words (TF-IDF), and authorship and - as fun side project, analysed the use of emojis.

## Word Prediction
This assignment is part of the Coursera Data Science Capstone project. The goal of this project is to create a text-prediction web application with R Shiny, that predicts the next word based on previous input using a natural language processing model. 

You can get the milestone report [here](/assets/milestone_report.html) .

Have a looke at the shiny web application [here](https://lisahlmsch.shinyapps.io/word_prediction_app/) .

The code for the application is [here](https://github.com/lisahlmsch/work_samples/blob/master/NLP%20word%20prediction/app.R) .

More information on the prediction algorithm and shiny application will follow soon.
