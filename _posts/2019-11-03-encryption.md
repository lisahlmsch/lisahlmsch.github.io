## Introduction

In this assignment we simulated a simplified message passing with https://www.ceu.edu: 

CEU.edu generates public and private keys and saves it to separate files. A visitor contacts CEU.edu, CEU.edu sends over it’s public key 
A visitor uses ceu.edu’s public key to encrypt a message. CEU decrypts the message with its private key.
