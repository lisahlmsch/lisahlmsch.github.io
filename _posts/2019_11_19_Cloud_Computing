## Cloud Computing

This project is about using AWS Cloud Services and setting up a t2.nano instance.
After logging into the instance I updated the operation system, installed nginx and modified the default html page.

You can find the documentation [here](/assets/cloud_aws.pdf).

## Sentiment Analysis using aws.comprehend

In this project I wrote an R script that included a function to scrape songtext lyrics with SelectorGadget on Google Chrome.
Then, for the top 25 songs of all times, I checked the language and sentiment using aws.comprehend package.

You can find the project [here](/assets/cloud_sentiment.pdf).
