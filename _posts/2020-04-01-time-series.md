## Correlation of GDP and commodity prices over time

In this assignment I am investigating how demand may be correlated with commodity prices. I analyzed quarterly GDP of Austria, Brent oil price and Gold price as a commodity.

## Prediction of energy output

The objective is to create a data model that predicts the net hourly electrical energy output (EP) of a Combined Cycle Power Plant using available hourly average ambient variables. I built an ANN Regression model to predict the electrical energy output utilizing the Machine Learning library Tensorflow 2.0, and Google Colab, the free, browser-based notebook environment that runs completely in the cloud.
